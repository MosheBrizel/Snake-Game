If the snake hits its tail, the game is over.

### Gameplay
The snake starts in the center of the screen. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake. When the snake passes over a piece of food, it will eat the food, grow, and a new piece of food will randomly spawn on the screen.

The goal is to eat as much food as possible while avoiding your own tail. Every piece of food you eat will add one point to your score.

If the snake hits the walls, it will wrap around to the other side. If the snake collides with its tail, the game is over.

### configuration
The speed and color of the snake can be changed by using the speed menu and the color picker in the menu.

Higher speeds make the game harder. The color of the snake can be adjusted.
